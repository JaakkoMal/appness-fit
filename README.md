# Appness Fit

A work in progress fitness application I am currently working on to learn more. At the moment the app has only been tested with an iPhone XR using Expo Go.
Optimization for Android will commence as soon I replace my piece of trash laptop with a one that runs Android emulator without coughing it's components out..

## Features so far:
- Create an account and sign in
- Log a workout and save it
- View logged workouts
- Update bodyweight and view a line chart showing the evolvement of bodyweight

More features are being added..

## Technologies used
- React Native
- Redux Toolkit
- Expo
- Firebase

To run the app, create your own Firebase project with email/password authentication and a Cloud Firestore.
-> npm install
-> expo start
